The scope of this project is to create the REST API needed for the aplication.
The application should handle just backend logic(no UI files).

For the first time use, you need to create the database manually(name TodoData), the tables will be created automatically by
setting the correct SQL connection string in appsettings files - both in REST and GRPC projects.
Also, make sure that you're setting up as a start-up projects both REST and GRPC projects.
